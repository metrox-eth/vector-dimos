"""PlayStation-style gamepad teleop for VECTOR - Twist out, pygame.joystick.

dimOS ships keyboard/phone/quest teleop but no gamepad; this module fills
the gap for VECTOR. Publishes into ``tele_cmd_vel`` (wire through dimOS's
MovementManager so navigation and teleop coexist), or remap to ``cmd_vel``
for direct drive.

Mapping (standard dual-stick):
    left stick Y  -> vx (forward)     left stick X  -> vy (strafe)
    right stick X -> wz (rotation)    R2 held       -> boost

Publishes ONLY while the deadman is held, plus a brake of zeros right after it
is released - 0.5 s by default, up to 1.0 s with VECTOR_BRAKE_S - then silence
(see BRAKE_S and resolve_brake_s). A pad lying at rest owns nothing, so the
same stack can explore on its own while the pad is plugged in. Pressing the
deadman again ends that brake window on the spot (BRAKE_CANCEL_ON_DEADMAN),
but only on a tick that is trusted and about to publish - see the worker.

WHICH BLUEPRINT (checked 2026-09-13, it is not the same wiring):
    dimos run vector-dimos.gamepad   -> tele_cmd_vel is REMAPPED to cmd_vel:
                                        direct drive, no nav, no MovementManager
    GAMEPAD=1 ... tools/fly.sh       -> `vector-dimos.explore` with this module
                                        ADDED and NOT remapped: the Twist goes
                                        tele_cmd_vel -> MovementManager -> cmd_vel
The second one is what the workshop trials run, so every "the pad is the
commander" shortcut is false there.

Runs headless: the Jetson has no display, so SDL is pinned to its dummy
video/audio drivers below. The pad is hot-pluggable - the module waits for
one instead of giving up at startup, and goes back to waiting if it is
unplugged, so ``dimos run vector-dimos.gamepad`` can be started before the
receiver is in.

# ── 2026-09-13: metrox's two complaints from the 30/08 piloted lap ──────────
# (docs/notes_etabli.md, his words) :
#   "transitions de commandes pas propres : relacher un stick puis le remettre
#    vite -> lag / collision de commandes"
#   "inertie teleop excessive : stick lache -> le rover glisse encore ~1,5 m"
# One constant per button. Restoring the 2026-09-12 flight is one line each:
# BRAKE_CANCEL_ON_DEADMAN = False, and brake_s left alone (0.5 s).

BRAKE_CANCEL_ON_DEADMAN = True
# A new deadman press CANCELS whatever is left of the brake window, on its
# RISING EDGE (brake_until = 0.0). From that instant the brake path cannot emit
# one more zero, however long the window was.
#
# MEASURED on the cold bench 2026-09-13, BEFORE this change, at 50 Hz with
# BRAKE_S = 0.5 s and the deadman re-pressed 0.200 s after the release: the
# module already published the stick command from the first tick after the
# press (+0.213 s -> 0.012 m/s, one slew step) and no zero after it. So this
# does NOT change the default flight, and it is NOT the cure for the felt lag
# (that one is the slew restarting from rest: 0.6 m/s2 = 0.75 s to the ceiling).
# What it buys is the right to LENGTHEN the zero window (brake_s below) without
# a stale zero from the release ever chasing a fresh command down the bus -
# which is precisely what the anti-inertia button wants to do.
# False = the 12/09 behaviour exactly: the window always runs to its end.

# The length of that window is now a knob, not a literal. 0.5 s is the value
# flown since 28/08 (see BRAKE_S); the anti-inertia trial raises it towards
# 1.0 s so the drives keep being TOLD to stop for longer instead of falling
# silent and free-wheeling. dimOS builds this module from a blueprint with no
# arguments of ours, so the environment is the operator's only lever:
#     VECTOR_BRAKE_S=1.0 tools/fly.sh GAMEPAD=1 REPOSITIONNE=1
BRAKE_S_ENV = "VECTOR_BRAKE_S"
BRAKE_S_MAX = 1.0
# Why the ceiling is 1.0 and not more - the cost, in seconds, not a story.
# dimOS's MovementManager treats ANY tele_cmd_vel message, zeros included, as
# "a human is driving": _on_teleop cancels the nav goal on EVERY message and
# _on_nav refuses to forward nav_cmd_vel until tele_cooldown_sec = 1.0 s has
# passed since the LAST teleop message (movement_manager.py, re-read
# 2026-09-13). So every release mutes autonomy for brake_s + 1.0 s: 1.5 s
# today, 2.0 s at this ceiling. That number IS the justification.
# TWO CLAIMS THAT USED TO STAND HERE AND WERE FALSE (adversarial review,
# 2026-09-13) - written down so nobody rebuilds on them:
#  1. "above the ceiling a pad at rest would mute exploration FOR GOOD". No:
#     whatever brake_s is, the zeros STOP at brake_s (see the worker loop) and
#     autonomy comes back 1.0 s later. "For good" was the pre-28/08 module,
#     which published 50 Hz of zeros for ever. The ceiling is prudence about
#     the 2 s above, not a cliff.
#  2. "in the GAMEPAD=1 blueprint the gamepad IS the commander (direct drive
#     to cmd_vel, no nav), so the cost there is zero". That describes
#     `vector-dimos.gamepad` (blueprints.py remaps tele_cmd_vel -> cmd_vel).
#     tools/fly.sh runs `vector-dimos.explore`, where GAMEPAD=1 only ADDS this
#     module with NO remapping (nav_blueprints.py): the pad publishes on
#     tele_cmd_vel and MovementManager IS in the path. The cost on the flight
#     metrox actually runs is 2.0 s, not zero.

BRAKE_UNTIL_STOPPED = False
# ASKED FOR on 2026-09-13, and NOT implemented on purpose - here is why, so
# nobody re-opens it blind. The idea: keep publishing zeros until the wheels
# actually read below BRAKE_STOP_RPM, capped at BRAKE_STOP_MAX_S, then silence.
# It needs wheel-speed feedback INSIDE this module, and this module has none:
# GamepadTeleop declares exactly one stream, `tele_cmd_vel: Out[Twist]`, and it
# runs in its own forkserver worker. The RPM feedback is read by
# VectorBaseAdapter (adapter.read_velocities) in the COORDINATOR's process,
# and nothing publishes it anywhere this module could subscribe to. Wiring it
# would mean: a new Out on the coordinator, a new In here, a blueprint
# remapping, and a new failure mode (feedback stops arriving -> the brake never
# ends -> the pad mutes autonomy for ever) - i.e. new machinery inside an armed
# chain, which is the one thing the 27/08 incident says not to do.
# THE FALLBACK IS brake_s ABOVE: a longer window of zeros, no new plumbing, one
# environment variable. Setting this flag True changes nothing but a warning.
BRAKE_STOP_RPM = 5.0        # kept as the spec of the day we do wire feedback
BRAKE_STOP_MAX_S = 2.0      # ...and its safety cap, so silence always comes
